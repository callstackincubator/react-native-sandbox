# Expo Sandbox Demo

![Platform: iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-iOS-blue.svg)

This example demonstrates the `react-native-sandbox` package working with Expo SDK 53, React Native 0.79, and React 19. It showcases how to run multiple isolated React Native instances side-by-side in an Expo environment, featuring a counter app and calculator app running in separate sandboxes with controlled communication capabilities.

The demo validates that the sandbox functionality works seamlessly with Expo's managed workflow, demonstrating the library's compatibility with the latest Expo and React Native versions while maintaining complete isolation between sandbox environments.
